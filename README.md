## Meet Your Sous Chef: What is an LLM?
* Large Language Model
* A predictive text assistant trained on vast data - like a sous chef trained in every recipe.
* You give it a prompt (your recipe) and it prepares a relevant, customized response (your dish).

## LLM Strengths: What Your Sous Chef Does Well
* Language Generation: Can whip up clear, fluent responses across formats
* Pattern recognition: Synthesizes information like combining ingredients into something new
* Rapid Response: Instantly brainstorms, drafts, or ideates on cue
* Flexible use cases: Can support any station like marketing or legal or education.

## LLM Weaknesses: Limitations of Your Sous Chef
* Hallucinations: May invent facts or substitute ingredients incorrectly
* No True Understanding: Predicts words but doesn't grasp meaning
* Limited Memory: Can forget earlier steps in a long recipe
* No Real-Time Awareness: Doesn't know what's in the fridge today unless you tell it
* Bias and Tone Drift: Can add seasoning you didn't ask for unless guided

## Common Pitfalls - and How to Stay in Control
* Hallucinations: Ask for sources or verify manually
* Missing context: Add background information or define the audience
* Off-brand tone: Include tone/style guidance in prompt
* Bias or sensitive content: Review critcally before sharing externally
* Outdated knowledge: Pair with real-time sources or apply human judgement

## 5-Step Process for LLMs (Cooking Workflow)
* Input: Supply the ingredients - words, context, instructions in the prompt
* Tokenization: The sous chef (LLM) breaks your prompt into smaller chunks, like chopping up ingredients into usable parts
* Encoding: The AI organizations those chunks and prepares the kitchen station - assigning numerical meaning
* Processing: The LLM processes everything by drawing on training to assemble a cohesive response.
* Output: Finally, your sous chef presents the finished dish tailored to your recipe (prompt).

## What is a Prompt?
* A prompt is the text or question you give to an AI model to guide its response.
  * It is like a set of instructions, a creative brief, or a recipe.
* Prompting is the recipe, and the LLM is your sous chef.
  * The better the recipe (prompt), the more effective the sous chef (LLM) can be in helping prepare the final dish (output).

## The 4 C's of Great Recipes (Prompts)
* Clear: Precise language, avoid ambuguity
* Concise: Use just enough detail, don't overexplain
* Commanding: Use imperatives like "Explain", "List", "Compare"
* Contextual: Provide relevant background as needed

## Prompt Template
* As a role, your mission is to task.
* Deliver this as a format, writing in the style of tone.
* Focus on achieving objective, but don't restriction.
* Additionally, aim to incorporate desired skill/technique.
