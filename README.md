## Meet Your Sous Chef: What is an LLM?
* Large Language Model
* A predictive text assistant trained on vast data - like a sous chef trained in every recipe.
* You give it a prompt (your recipe) and it prepares a relevant, customized response (your dish).

## LLM Strengths: What Your Sous Chef Does Well
* Language Generation: Can whip up clear, fluent responses across formats
* Pattern recognition: Synthesizes information like combining ingredients into something new
* Rapid Response: Instantly brainstorms, drafts, or ideates on cue
* Flexible use cases: Can support any station like marketing or legal or education.

## LLM Weaknesses: Limitations of Your Sous Chef
* Hallucinations: May invent facts or substitute ingredients incorrectly
* No True Understanding: Predicts words but doesn't grasp meaning
* Limited Memory: Can forget earlier steps in a long recipe
* No Real-Time Awareness: Doesn't know what's in the fridge today unless you tell it
* Bias and Tone Drift: Can add seasoning you didn't ask for unless guided
